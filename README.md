💻 Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1️⃣: Clone the Project Repository

Open a terminal and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hotel_booking.git
cd hotel_booking

This command downloads the project to your system and navigates to the project directory.

Step 2️⃣: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated.
Run the following commands:

python -m venv venv         # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate    # Activate on Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # Activate on Windows


---

Step 3️⃣: Install Project Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This ensures you have all the necessary libraries installed.


---

Step 4️⃣: Apply Database Migrations

Django requires setting up the database structure. Run:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

This will create the necessary tables in the database.


---

Step 5️⃣: Create a Superuser

To access the admin panel, you need a superuser account. Run:

python manage.py createsuperuser

Provide a username, email, and password as prompted.


---

Step 6️⃣: Run the Development Server

Launch the application locally using:

python manage.py runserver

Access the project by opening your browser and navigating to:
